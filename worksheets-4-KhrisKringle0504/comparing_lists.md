1.  For each problem description state whether you would want to use an `Array`, an `ArrayList` or a `LinkedList`, and write why your choice would be appropriate.  You may assume the `LinkedList` is doubly linked if you wish. Think about the relative strenghts and weaknesses of the different kinds of lists.

    1. You are keeping track of customers at a deli counter (but can’t get your hands on one of the cool take a number things).  When customers get to the counter, they will put their name at the end of a list.  When you help a customer, you will remove their name from the beginning of the list.

    2. You want to take a random sample of data from a list.  You don’t know how much data will be in the list (users will be inputting the data before you get to it).  You will get the random sample by choosing a random index between 0 and the list’s size – 1 and taking the data from that index (repeating many times)
